Sustainability Planning and Policy (BS)

Sustainability Planning and Policy explores the intricate relationships between ecological, economic, social, and political systems, as well as the behaviors and policies that influence these interactions. At its core, sustainability studies seek to understand human impact on the natural and human environments and promote responsible stewardship of natural resources. This field of study also encompasses economic development, social equity, governance institutions, education, public opinion, civil society, and ethical considerations related to social responsibility. Given its interdisciplinary nature, sustainability is a fundamental theme across multiple programs within the School of Economic, Political, and Policy Sciences (EPPS).

Mission Statement

The mission of the BS in Sustainability Planning and Policy program is to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and tools to address the complex environmental, social, and economic challenges of sustainable development. The program will prepare graduates to develop and implement innovative plans, policies, and solutions that promote sustainability using both theoretical principles and cutting-edge technologies. It fosters a commitment to resilience, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship within communities and organizations.

Students within the program will:

Gain a deep understanding of concepts, theories, and principles for sustainable development
Analyze human-environment interactions and their impacts on global and local environments
Apply advanced technologies, methods, techniques, and planning practices to address sustainable challenges
Evaluate environmental policies and regulations influencing sustainable developments
