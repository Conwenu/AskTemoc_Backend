Robotics and Mechatronics
Business and Financial Engineering
Energy Systems
Healthcare Systems
Public Policy

The plan must include sufficient upper-division courses to total 45 upper-division semester credit hours.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

In response to the need for advanced education in Systems Engineering, a Fast Track program is available to well-qualified UT Dallas undergraduate students. Qualified seniors may take up to 15 graduate semester credit hours that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy the requirements for the master's degree. This is accomplished by (1) taking courses (typically electives) during one or more summer semesters, and (2) beginning graduate coursework during the senior year. Details are available from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education.

Minors

The Department of Systems Engineering does not offer minors at this time.

1. A required Major course that also fulfills a Core Curriculum requirement. Semester credit hours are counted in Core Curriculum.

2. Semester credit hours fulfill the communication component of the Core Curriculum.

3. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted under Mathematics Core, and five semester credit hours of Calculus are counted as Component Area Option Core.

4. Six semester credit hours of Physics are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics (PHYS 2125) is counted as Component Area Option Core.
