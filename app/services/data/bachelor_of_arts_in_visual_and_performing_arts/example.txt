NOTES:
1	Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2	Students completing the 020 requirement with a MATH course must complete ALEKS exam prior to enrollment. PHIL 2303 does not require the ALEKS exam.
3	Discipline I Prep Course = 1000 or 2000-level course with a prefix from AHST, ARTS, COMM, DANC, FILM, MUSI, or THEA. The prefix selected must match that of other Discipline I courses. NOTE: If the student took one of these courses as their core, then the student may choose any free elective in its place as a lower-level major requirement.
4	Discipline II Prep Course = 1000 or 2000-level course with a prefix from AHST, ARTS, COMM, DANC, FILM, MUSI, or THEA. The prefix selected cannot be the same as Discipline I, but must match that of other Discipline II courses. NOTE: If the student took one of these courses as their core, then the student may choose any free elective in its place as a lower-level major requirement.
5	Major Core = VPAS 3340, VPAS 4389, (VPAS 4390 or VPAS 4V99) and 3 semester credit hours of upper-level Related Courses from the School of Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology (excluding prefixes used in Discipline I and II)

One of the Discipline courses must be historical in nature.
7	Free Elective = any lower or upper-level course. Students may need to take some as upper-level to meet the university requirement of earning a minimum of 45 semester credit hours of upper-level courses.
