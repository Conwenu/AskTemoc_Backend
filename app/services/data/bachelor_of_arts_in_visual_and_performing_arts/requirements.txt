Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Visual and Performing Arts (BA) with Interdisciplinary Arts Concentration

Students who complete the major in Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) pursue an interdisciplinary study of the arts by completing a major core that includes courses in writing, interdisciplinary studies, historical context, theory and practice. The VPA major culminates in a Senior Capstone. Students who are majoring in VPA can focus their studies by choosing from nine possible concentrations.

The Interdisciplinary Arts concentration focuses student work in two discipline areas. Students will choose two different areas of focus, identified as Discipline I and Discipline II. Discipline areas must be from the following: Visual Art, Art History, Communication, Dance, Film, Music, and Theatre.

At least one-half of the total semester credit hours for major requirements must be taken at UT Dallas.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Visual and Performing Arts are open to all students in the University.
