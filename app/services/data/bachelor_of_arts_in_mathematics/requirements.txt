Mathematics (BA, BS)

Mathematics is both a profession and an indispensable tool for many types of work. As a tool, mathematics is a universal language that has been crucial in formulating and expressing ideas not only in science and engineering, but also in many other areas such as business and the social sciences. As probably the oldest and most basic science, it provides the key to understanding the major technological achievements of our time.

Of equal importance, knowledge of mathematics may help provide a student with the type of uncompromising and clear-sighted thinking useful in considering the problems of many other disciplines. The Mathematics degree program encompasses mathematics, statistics, and applied mathematics. The Mathematical Sciences Department also administers a Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science.

Students interested in obtaining either a BA or a BS in Mathematics and Teacher Certification in the state of Texas should consult the UTeach Dallas office or the Teacher Development Center for specific requirements as soon as possible after formal admission to the University. See the Teacher Education Certification Programs section of the catalog for additional information.

The Mathematics degree program also prepares students for graduate studies. Accelerated BS/MS Fast Track programs are available that provide the opportunity to partially satisfy the requirements of a master's degree while completing the bachelor's degree in Mathematics.

The Program in Mathematics

Students seeking a degree in Mathematics may choose from a variety of courses, which allow for flexibility and specialization so that students can better adapt their educational experience to further their academic goals. Students entering the field of mathematics at UT Dallas are prepared not only for careers in these areas, but also in numerous other professions that require expertise in mathematics.

Students who pursue a BS degree in mathematics typically use their degree in the fields of mathematics, statistics, science, or engineering. BS students choose a specialization in either mathematics, statistics or applied mathematics.

Mathematics Specialization: For students interested in a career in mathematics and for those who choose to continue their education at the graduate level in mathematics, applied mathematics, mathematics education or disciplines, such as statistics and data science, which use mathematics.

Statistics Specialization: For students interested in probability and statistical models and their use in data analysis and decision making; for students interested in continuing on to graduate work in statistics, biostatistics, data science, actuarial science, and other statistics-related areas.

Applied Mathematics Specialization: For students interested in mathematics for the purpose of using it broadly in various application areas and for students interested in continuing on to graduate work in applied mathematics or related areas.

Students who pursue a BA degree in mathematics generally use mathematics as background for study in fields such as arts and technology, education, engineering or science.

UTeach Option

The UTeach option may be added to either the BA or BS degree. UTeach Dallas Option degree plans are streamlined to allow students to complete both a rigorous Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree and all coursework for middle or high school teacher certification in four years. Teaching Option degrees require deep content knowledge combined with courses grounded in the latest research on math and science education. While most graduates go on to classroom teaching, UTeach alums are also prepared to enter graduate school and to work in a discipline related industry.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

For students with strong academic record who intend to pursue master's studies at UT Dallas, accelerated BS/MS Fast Tracks are available. After Fast Track admission to an MS program, students may take up to 15 semester credit hours of approved graduate courses in their senior year to use toward completion of both the BS and MS degrees. The available Fast Track options and their admission requirements, if any, in addition to having completed 90 or more semester credit hours (out of which 36 hours are from the core curriculum) with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00, are as follows:

MS in Mathematics: Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.
MS in Statistics: Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.

Interested students, after reviewing the UT Dallas Fast Track policy, should contact their undergraduate advisor and the graduate advisor of the intended MS program well in advance of their junior year to prepare a course sequence permitting maximal advantage and apply to the Fast Track program.

Minors

Students must take a minimum of 18 semester credit hours for the minor, 12 of which must be upper-division semester credit hours. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). Semester credit hours may not be used to satisfy both the major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor.

For all minors in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics students must complete all prerequisite sequences for required minor courses.

Minor in Mathematics

18 semester credit hours

The minor in Mathematics requires 18 semester credit hours math or statistics course requirements. Of these 18, 12 semester credit hours will be selected from a specific set of courses.

12 semester credit hours of courses must be chosen from the following:

MATH 3310 Theoretical Concepts of Calculus

MATH 4334 Numerical Analysis

And select two more upper-division mathematics courses that satisfy degree requirements by students in Mathematical Sciences.

The remaining 6 semester credit hours can be satisfied by choosing either MATH or STAT courses with advisor approval.

Minor in Statistics

18 semester credit hours

The minor in Statistics requires 18 semester credit hours math or statistics course requirements. Of these 18, 12 semester credit hours will be selected from a specific set of courses.

12 semester credit hours of courses must be chosen from the following:

STAT 4351 Probability

STAT 4352 Mathematical Statistics

And select two more upper-division mathematics courses that satisfy degree requirements by students in Mathematical Sciences.

The remaining 6 semester credit hours can be satisfied by choosing either MATH or STAT courses with advisor approval.
