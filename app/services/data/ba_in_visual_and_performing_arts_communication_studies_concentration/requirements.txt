Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Visual and Performing Arts (BA) with Communication Studies Concentration

Students who complete the major in Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) pursue an interdisciplinary study of the arts by completing a major core that includes courses in writing, interdisciplinary studies, historical context, theory, and practice. The VPA major culminates in a Senior Capstone. Students who are majoring in VPA can focus their studies by choosing from nine possible concentrations.

The Communication Studies concentration focuses student work on the theories, concepts, and skills of oral, written, and mediated communication. Communication courses teach students how to engage in critical thinking and problem solving, to participate effectively in meetings and in teams, and to communicate competently in relationships and in public speaking contexts.

At least one-half of the total semester credit hours for major requirements must be taken at UT Dallas.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Visual and Performing Arts are open to all students in the University.
