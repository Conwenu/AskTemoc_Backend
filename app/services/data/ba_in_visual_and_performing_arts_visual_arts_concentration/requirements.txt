Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Visual and Performing Arts (BA) with Visual Arts Concentration

Students who complete the major in Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) pursue an interdisciplinary study of the arts by completing a major core that includes courses in writing, interdisciplinary studies, historical context, theory, and practice. The VPA major culminates in a Senior Capstone. Students who are majoring in VPA can focus their studies by choosing from nine possible concentrations.

The Visual Arts concentration focuses on student work in design, drawing, painting, photography, printmaking, and sculpture. Students will learn traditional and cutting-edge techniques as well as acquiring a broad base of knowledge in art history.

At least one-half of the total semester credit hours for major requirements must be taken at UT Dallas.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Visual and Performing Arts are open to all students in the University.
