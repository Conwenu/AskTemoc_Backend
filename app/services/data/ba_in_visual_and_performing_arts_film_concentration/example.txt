NOTES:
1	Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2	Students completing the 020 requirement with a MATH course must complete ALEKS exam prior to enrollment. PHIL 2303 does not require the ALEKS exam.
3	If the student takes FILM 2332 as their 050 core, then the student may choose any free elective in its place as a lower-level major requirement.
4	Lower-Division Major Req - 7 semester credit hours beyond Core Curriculum - AHTC 1100, FILM 2332, and 3 semester credit hours of lower-level Visual and Performing Arts Prep Course
5	Major Core - 12 semester credit hours - VPAS 3340, VPAS 4389, and (VPAS 4390 or VPAS 4V99) and 3 semester credit hours of upper-level Related Courses from AHTC (excluding the AHST prefix)
6	FILM Concentration - 36 semester credit hours - 15 semester credit hours from the following (FILM 1303, FILM 3321, FILM 3325, FILM 3326, FILM 3342, FILM 4V71) and 6 semester credit hours of upper-division Visual and Performing Arts electives and 15 semester credit hours of Major Related courses (any combination of upper-division courses from AHTC).
7	Free Elective - 23-29 semester credit hours - any lower or upper-level course. Students may need to take some as upper-level to meet the university requirement of earning a minimum of 45 semester credit hours of upper-level courses.

Be sure to check prerequisites of 2000-level or higher courses.
