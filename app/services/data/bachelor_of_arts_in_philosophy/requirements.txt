Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Philosophy (BA)

Philosophy is one of the most broad-based, rigorous, interdisciplinary, and socially engaged of the liberal arts. Philosophy poses deep, important, and persistent questions concerning the nature of the good life, why we believe and how we know, the nature of the self and its connection with the world and with society, and the foundations of justice. Philosophy takes up such questions through critical analysis of textual evidence, clear and rigorous argumentation, and questioning of unexamined personal and cultural assumptions. The study of the history of philosophy from all cultures proves central to this process.

Far from being an abstruse, removed, and self-contained pursuit, Philosophy at UT Dallas engages in an interdisciplinary Arts & Humanities program, drawing on and contributing to the study of history, literature, and the arts. Our program is also particularly suited to the STEM excellence of UT Dallas, with a practical and theoretical emphasis on the philosophy of science, technology, and medicine. Finally, the UT Dallas Philosophy BA program strives to be highly pluralistic and intellectually diverse, with emphases in continental, analytic, feminist, American, and non-Western philosophical traditions.

At least one-half of the semester credit hours for a major must be taken at UT Dallas.

III. Elective Requirements: 47 semester credit hours

Free Electives: 47 semester credit hours

Both upper- and lower-division courses may be used as electives.

Philosophy majors interested in graduate study should strongly consider using some of their free electives for foreign language study in a language that would support an area of their philosophical interest. Similarly, students with a primary interest in areas of philosophy that depend on outside domains of knowledge (such as philosophy of science or philosophy of mind) should consider using some of their free electives for advanced study or a minor in the relevant field.

Students may want to consider using some free elective credit to complete one of the approved minors offered by UT-Dallas, and should consult their academic advisor for more information about their choices.

The plan must include sufficient upper-division courses to total 45 upper-division semester credit hours.

Minors

Students must take a minimum of 18 semester credit hours for the minor. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). Semester credit hours may not be used to satisfy both the major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor. Core courses offered by the school may count as lower-division semester credit hours toward the minor. Topics courses must be approved by the school. The Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology will substitute courses as necessary. At least one-third of the semester credit hours for a minor must be taken at The University of Texas at Dallas.

Minor in Philosophy

18 semester credit hours

Choose any 18 semester credit hours from all PHIL courses. Must meet the University minimum number of upper-division hours.

1. A required Preparatory course that also fulfills a Core Curriculum requirement. Semester credit hours may be counted in Core Curriculum.

2. 1 semester credit hours beyond Core Curriculum, if the student has not previously completed other courses to satisfy these core curriculum requirements.

3. These courses may have prerequisites not listed in the degree plan, and may add to the student's time to degree.
