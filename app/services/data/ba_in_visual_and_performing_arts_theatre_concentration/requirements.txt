Visual and Performing Arts (BA) with Theatre Concentration

Students who complete the major in Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) pursue an interdisciplinary study of the arts by completing a major core that includes courses in writing, interdisciplinary studies, historical context, theory, and practice. The VPA major culminates in a Senior Capstone. Students who are majoring in VPA can focus their studies by choosing from nine possible concentrations.

The Theatre concentration focuses on student work in areas of theatre including: Acting, Stage Management, Technical Theatre, Design, Musical Theatre, Directing, Voice Over, Playwriting, Dance, and Production Ensemble. Additionally, students will develop knowledge in theatre history and literature.

At least one-half of the total semester credit hours for major requirements must be taken at UT Dallas.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Visual and Performing Arts are open to all students in the University.
