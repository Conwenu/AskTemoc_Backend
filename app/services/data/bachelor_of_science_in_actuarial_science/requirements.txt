Actuarial Science (BS)

The Bachelor of Science Actuarial Science (AS) Program at The University of Texas at Dallas is administered through the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Students receive rigorous well-rounded actuarial education with a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, computer and data science, economics, and finance. All students are prepared to take seven actuarial preliminary Society of Actuaries (SOA) exams: Probability - P/1, Financial Mathematics - FM/2, Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics - FAM, Advanced Short Term Actuarial Mathematics - ASTAM, Advanced Long Term Actuarial Mathematics - ALTAM, Statistics for Risk Modeling - SRM, Predictive Analytics - PA. Students achieve Validation of Educational Experience (VEE) credits in Accounting and Finance, Economics, and Mathematical Statistics. Students also receive rigorous instruction in preparation for a major part of the three Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) Exams: Actuarial Models: Financial Economics - 3F, Modern Actuarial Statistics I and II - MAS I and MAS II. Upon completion of this program, students will have the knowledge and business background necessary to pursue a career as an actuary, as well as to undertake graduate study in actuarial science, statistics, mathematics, economics, data science or finance.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

In response to the need for post-baccalaureate education, a Fast Track program is available to well-qualified UT Dallas undergraduate students. Qualified seniors may take up to 15 graduate semester credit hours that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy the requirements for the master's degree. Interested students should see the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education (ADU) for specific requirements.

1. A required Major preparatory course that also fulfills a Core Curriculum requirement. Semester credit hours are counted in Core Curriculum.

2. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted to fulfill the Mathematics Core Requirement with the remaining one semester credit hour to be counted under Component Area Option Core Requirement.

3. Students may choose one of the following calculus sequences: (a) MATH 2413, MATH 2414, and MATH 2415; or (b) MATH 2417 and MATH 2419.

4. Six semester credit hours of Physics or Chemistry are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics or Chemistry (PHYS 2125 or CHEM 1111) are counted under Component Area Option core.

5. Please consult your advisor if selecting Honors Physics.

6. Students may use three semester credit hours of PHYS 2421 to count under Science core, and one semester credit hour of PHYS 2421 under Component Area Option core.

7. MATH 2370 will provide basic knowledge of a programming and numeric computing platform MATLAB and a better preparation for MATH 4334 if elected.

8. Students who complete PHYS 2421 do not need to complete PHYS 2125.

Minors

Students must take a minimum of 18 semester credit hours for the minor, 12 of which must be upper-division semester credit hours. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). Semester credit hours may not be used to satisfy both the major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor.

For all minors in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics students must complete all prerequisite sequences for required minor courses.

Minor in Actuarial Science

23 semester credit hours

The Minor in Actuarial Science program at UT Dallas is administered through the Department of Mathematical Sciences. It is ideal for students who are interested in broadening their experience and knowledge base in the study and analysis of principles of Actuarial Science. The minor core courses prepare students for a number of actuarial exams required for a designation of Associate of the Society of Actuaries, Casualty Actuarial Society, or Canadian Institute of Actuaries. All of the courses in the minor serve as starting points for learning the concepts covered on the preliminary actuarial exams (P/1 - Probability, FM/2 - Financial Mathematics, portions of FAM-L - Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics, ALTAM - Advanced Long Term Actuarial Mathematics) and Finance VEE (Validation by Educational Experience) requirement.

Students not majoring in Actuarial Science may obtain a minor in Actuarial Science by satisfying 23 semester credit hours (11 semester credit hours of minor core courses and 12 semester credit hours of minor preparatory courses).

Minor Preparatory Courses (11 semester credit hours)9

MATH 2415 Calculus of Several Variables

or MATH 2419 Calculus II

MATH 3351 Advanced Calculus

9. Students whose major does not require MATH 2417 and MATH 2419 as part of their Mathematics and Component Area Option Core Curriculum Requirements, should take this sequence as their core curriculum courses to ensure efficiency toward the minor.

10. These classes prepare for the major parts of three preliminary actuarial examinations administered by the Society of Actuaries (SOA), Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS), and the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA).
