NOTES:
1	Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2	A required Major preparatory course that also fulfills a Core Curriculum requirement. Semester credit hours are counted in Core Curriculum.
3	Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted to fulfill the Mathematics Core Requirement with the remaining five semester credit hours to be counted under Component Area Option Core.
4	Six semester credit hours of Physics or Chemistry are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics or Chemistry (PHYS 2125 or CHEM 1111) is counted under Component Area Core.
5	MATH 2417 and MATH 2419 requirements can be fulfilled by completing MATH 2413, MATH 2414, and MATH 2415.
6	MATH 2370 will provide better preparation for MATH 4334.
7	Please consult your advisor if selecting Honors Physics.
8	Students who complete PHYS 2421 do not need to complete PHYS 2125.

45 Hours of upper division courses (course numbers beginning with 3 or greater) are required for all degrees.
Be sure to check prerequisites of 2000-level or higher courses.
120 semester credit hours required for graduation

Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) during the summer are highly recommended for Mathematics majors planning to continue their education in graduate school, whether in Mathematics or another discipline. Formal REU programs exist at many universities, national laboratories, and even overseas, and usually offer a stipend typical of a graduate teaching assistantship. Announcements for REU programs usually appear online in December and application deadlines usually range from late January to early March. Requirements vary, but students are often eligible if they have completed their freshman year.

This plan is a resource tool only; it does not replace your degree plan or academic advising.
