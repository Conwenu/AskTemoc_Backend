Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Visual and Performing Arts (BA) with Music Concentration

Students who complete the major in Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) pursue an interdisciplinary study of the arts by completing a major core that includes courses in writing, interdisciplinary studies, historical context, theory, and practice. The VPA major culminates in a Senior Capstone. Students who are majoring in VPA can focus their studies by choosing from nine possible concentrations.

The Music concentration allows students to develop a strong musical background through private study of their primary instrument or voice, along with music theory, composition/digital music, and history/literature. Opportunities to perform include solo performance, chamber music and large ensembles. Ensembles are available for voice, harp, guitar, strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and mixed chamber groups.

Admission into the university does not guarantee acceptance into the Visual & Performing Arts Music concentration. Acceptance into the Visual & Performing Arts Music concentration depends on completing a successful audition in the primary instrument or voice. Information about auditions, including online submissions, in-person dates, and repertoire options, is available at music.utdallas.edu.

At least one-half of the total semester credit hours for major requirements must be taken at UT Dallas.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Visual and Performing Arts are open to all students in the University.
