Child Learning and Development (BS)

Providing better ways to foster the intellectual and emotional development of children is a national priority. Well-educated university graduates are needed to become expert child development practitioners and researchers. The academic disciplines of developmental psychology and child development have accumulated a vast body of research-based knowledge about the factors that promote optimal child learning, development, and well-being. The Child Learning and Development major provides undergraduate students with a rigorous science-based curriculum that immerses them in the theories, findings, research methods, and best practices that the scientific study of child development has to offer.

The Child Learning and Development major focuses on the fundamental processes of child and adolescent development within the contexts of families, schools, peer groups, and larger cultural milieu. It provides students with a strong foundation in 1) cognitive, language, and socio-emotional development, 2) research skills for conducting and evaluating scientific studies, and 3) translating scientific findings into practical applications for understanding and improving children's lives. In addition to coursework, students may also take advantage of opportunities for supervised and independent research, as well as field placements that involve working with children, families, schools, and social services.

The Child Learning and Development major prepares students for a wide range of careers in education, psychology, early childhood and infant intervention, social work, family medicine, public health, family law, and public policy. The major is also well suited for students seeking elementary teacher certification (early childhood - 6th grade) through UT Dallas' Teacher Development Center. By combining a major in Child Learning and Development with elementary teacher certification, students develop a strong foundation in child development and teaching. Elementary Teacher Certification requires a minimum of 45 additional semester credit hours of coursework that can be completed within the free elective semester credit hours of the Child Learning and Development major. If you are interested in this combined child development/education program (called CLD/EC6), see an advisor to develop a degree plan.
