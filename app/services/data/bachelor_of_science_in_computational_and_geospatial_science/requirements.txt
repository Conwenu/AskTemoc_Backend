Computational and Geospatial Science (BS)

Computational and Geospatial Science is an interdisciplinary field that explores the management, analysis, and application of geospatial data to solve real-world challenges. It focuses on the complexities of location-based data and its integration into various systems and industries. This field combines advanced computational techniques with geospatial principles to address pressing issues across multiple domains.

Applications of computational and geospatial science include web-based mapping services, which provide interactive tools for navigation and location-based services; national security and intelligence operations, supported by organizations such as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; energy planning and management to optimize resources and infrastructure; environmental management to monitor and protect natural ecosystems; military operations requiring spatial intelligence for strategy and logistics; support of statewide and national government agencies such as FEMA or the Census Bureau; and disaster response, where geospatial data is critical for planning, risk assessment, and mitigation efforts.

By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Computational and Geospatial Science will be skilled in handling large-scale geospatial datasets, developing innovative solutions, and contributing to advancements in various industries that depend on spatial information.

Mission

The mission of Computational and Geospatial Science is to equip students with a strong interdisciplinary foundation that integrates computer science (CS) principles with geospatial information science (GIS) applications. This program aims to produce graduates who are proficient in computational thinking, algorithm design, and software development, while also being adept at leveraging geospatial technologies to solve real-world problems. Students gain expertise in data analysis, spatial data management, and advanced geospatial modeling, preparing them to address complex issues with computational skills in areas which involve geospatial data and location-based information systems. Graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Computational and Geospatial Science program will be uniquely prepared to address complex, location-based challenges that are increasingly important in our interconnected and rapidly changing world.

Objectives

The program education objectives will enable our graduates within a few years of graduation to:

Pursue diverse career opportunities in computer science, geospatial information science, or related fields, including roles as industry professionals, educators, researchers, government officials, and entrepreneurs.
Demonstrate effective teamwork and leadership skills in both professional and interdisciplinary settings, contributing meaningfully to projects in computer science and/or geospatial information science.
Uphold ethical, socially responsible, and innovative practices that advance industry, academia, and society.
Engage in lifelong learning and professional growth, successfully adapting to continuous advancements in computational and geospatial technologies.
