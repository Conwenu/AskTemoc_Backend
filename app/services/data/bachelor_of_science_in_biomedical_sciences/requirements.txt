Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

For students with strong academic record who intend to pursue master's studies at UT Dallas, accelerated BS/MS Fast Tracks are available. After Fast Track admission to an MS program, students may take up to 15 semester credit hours of approved graduate courses in their senior year to use toward completion of both the BS and MS degrees. The available Fast Track options and their admission requirements, if any, in addition to having completed 90 or more semester credit hours (of which 36 hours are from the core curriculum) with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00, are as follows:

MS in Biotechnology: Students must have a GPA of at least 3.20 and have completed BIOL 2311, BIOL 2312, and BIOL 2281, or equivalent courses.
MS in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology: Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.
MS in Data Science and Statistics: (Only Data Science and Applied Statistics specializations) Students must be on the Data Analytics Track and have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.

Interested students, after reviewing the UT Dallas Fast Track policy, should contact their undergraduate advisor and the graduate advisor of the intended MS program well in advance of their junior year to prepare a course sequence permitting maximal advantage and apply to the Fast Track program.
