NOTES:
1	Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2	A required Major course that also fulfills Core Curriculum requirements. If semester credit hours are counted in the Core Curriculum, students must complete additional coursework to meet the minimum requirement for graduation. Course selection assistance is available from the undergraduate advisor.
3	Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted to fulfill the Mathematics Core Requirement with the remaining five semester credit hours to be counted under Component Area Option Core.
4	MATH 2417 and MATH 2419 requirements can be fulfilled by completing MATH 2413, MATH 2414, and MATH 2415.
5	Six semester credit hours of Physics are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics (PHYS 2125) is counted under Component Area Core. Students may use three semester credit hours of PHYS 2421 to count under Science core, and one semester credit hour of PHYS 2421 under Component Area Option core.
6	Students will take one of the Physics sequences: (PHYS 2325 and PHYS 2326) or (PHYS 2421 and PHYS 2422) with accompanying labs.
7	Indicates a prerequisite class to be completed before enrolling in upper-division classes.
8	45 hours of upper division courses are required for all degrees.

Needed prerequisites are satisfied if above degree program is followed in the sequence as indicated. Otherwise please see the catalog for prerequisite requirements.
45 Hours of upper division courses (course numbers beginning with 3 or greater) are required for all degrees.
Be sure to check prerequisites of 2000-level or higher courses.
120 semester credit hours required for graduation

Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) during the summer are highly recommended for Mathematics majors planning to continue their education in graduate school, whether in Mathematics or another discipline. Formal REU programs exist at many universities, national laboratories, and even overseas, and usually offer a stipend typical of a graduate teaching assistantship. Announcements for REU programs usually appear online in December and application deadlines usually range from late January to early March. Requirements vary, but students are often eligible if they have completed their freshman year.

This plan is a resource tool only; it does not replace your degree plan or academic advising.
