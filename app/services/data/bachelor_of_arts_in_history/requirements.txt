Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
History (BA)

The study of history aims to promote a broader, more critical understanding of the world and our place in it, to give students the ability to contextualize events in the present by distinguishing them from past times and places, and thus to provide the basis for making informed decisions in the public sphere. While the interpretive and communication skills students develop as History majors will be of value to them in their work lives, the History major aims at humanistic understanding rather than specific vocational ends. Because the term "history" refers to both the object of study (the human past) and to the discipline by which we claim to know that past, the History major at the University of Texas at Dallas aspires to both expansive knowledge of the past, achieved through breadth and distribution requirements, and critical assessment of the means by which historians reconstruct and interpret the past, emphasized in the required Historical Inquiry course, the disciplinary focus requirement, and the research project undertaken in the Senior year.

Students who complete the major in History may design distinctive degree programs by selecting among courses in a range of geographical areas, time periods, approaches to the study of history, and topical subject matters. Students are encouraged to focus their work in History on a particular time or place, significant theme, topic, or problem, and to balance breadth and range of historical study with depth in a particular subject. Students may also be certified to teach history and/or social studies.

At least one-half of the semester credit hours for a major must be taken at UT Dallas.

Most upper-division courses in History are open to all students in the University who have met lower-division core requirements.

Minors

Students must take a minimum of 18 semester credit hours for the minor. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). Semester credit hours may not be used to satisfy both the major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor. Core courses offered by the school may count as lower-division semester credit hours toward the minor. Topics courses must be approved by the school. The Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology will substitute courses as necessary. At least one-third of the semester credit hours for a minor must be taken at The University of Texas at Dallas.
