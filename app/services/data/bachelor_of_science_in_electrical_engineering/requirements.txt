The Electrical Engineering program offers students an opportunity to acquire a solid foundation in the broad areas of electrical engineering and emphasizes advanced study in digital systems, digital signal processing, communications, power systems, analog systems, RF/microwave, and microelectronics.

The Electrical Engineering program offers students a solid educational foundation in the areas of electrical networks, electronics, electromagnetics, computers, digital systems, signal processing, and communications and is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Mastery of these areas provides students with the ability to adapt and maintain leadership roles in their post- baccalaureate pursuits through the application of fundamental principles to a rapidly changing and growing discipline.

Students in the Electrical Engineering program a broad general program in electrical engineering and can then take advanced courses in computer hardware and software; the analysis and design of analog and digital communication systems; analog and digital signal processing; the analysis, design, and fabrication of microelectronic components and systems; power systems, and guided and unguided wave propagation. A broad choice of electives (within and external to electrical engineering) allows students to broaden their education as well as develop expertise in areas of particular interest. In keeping with the role of a professional, students are expected to develop communication skills and an awareness of the relationship between technology and society.

The Electrical Engineering program is based on a solid foundation of science and mathematics coursework. Students in this program are given an opportunity to learn and extend their abilities to analyze and solve complex problems and to design new uses of technology to serve today's society. The engineering programs at UT Dallas provide an integrated educational experience directed toward the development of the ability to apply pertinent knowledge to the identification and solution of practical problems in Electrical and other related engineering fields. These programs ensure that the design experience, which includes both analytical and experimental studies, is integrated throughout the curriculum in a sequential development leading to advanced work. Design problems are frequently assigned in both lecture and laboratory courses. Each student is required to complete a major design project during the senior year. In addition, established cooperative education programs with area industry serve to further supplement design experiences.

High School Preparation

Engineering education requires a strong high school preparation. Pre-engineering students should have high school preparation of at least one-half year in trigonometry and at least one year each in elementary algebra, intermediate and advanced algebra, plane geometry, chemistry, and physics, thus developing their competencies to the highest possible levels and preparing to move immediately into demanding college courses in calculus, calculus-based physics, and chemistry for science majors. It is also essential that pre- engineering students have the competence to read rapidly and with comprehension, and to write clearly and correctly.

Lower-Division Study

All lower-division students in Electrical Engineering concentrate on mathematics, science, and introductory engineering courses, building competence in these cornerstone areas for future application in upper-division engineering courses. The following requirements apply both to students seeking to transfer to UT Dallas from other institutions as well as to those currently enrolled at UT Dallas, whether in another school or in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science.

ABET Accreditation

The BS program in Electrical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.

Academic Progress in Electrical Engineering

In order to make satisfactory academic progress as an Electrical Engineering major, a student must meet all University requirements for academic progress, and must earn a grade of C- or better in each of the "major requirements" courses.

For this reason, not all classes offered by the University can be used to meet elective requirements. Please check with your academic advisor before enrolling in classes you hope to use as free electives.

The plan must include sufficient upper-division courses to total 45 upper-division semester credit hours.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

In response to the need for advanced education in electrical engineering, a Fast Track program is available to well-qualified UT Dallas undergraduate students. Qualified seniors may take up to 15 graduate semester credit hours that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy the requirements for the master's degree. This is accomplished by (1) taking courses (typically electives) during one or more summer semesters, and (2) beginning graduate coursework during the senior year. Details are available from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education.

Honors Program

The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers Departmental Honors for outstanding students in the BS Electrical Engineering degree program. Admission to the Honors programs requires that the student meet the following qualifications:

Has repeated no more than 3 courses at UT Dallas and has repeated no course more than once.

Graduation with Honors requires a 3.500 or better GPA and completion of either EE 4399 or EE 4V98. A Senior Honors Thesis must be completed within one of those two classes. (While the topics may be related, the Senior Thesis does not replace the need for the student to complete a regular Senior Design Project).

Departmental Honors with Distinction may be awarded to students whose Senior Honors Thesis is judged by a faculty committee to be of exemplary quality. Only students graduating with Departmental Honors are eligible. Thesis/projects must be submitted by the deadline that applies to MS Theses in the graduating semester to allow for proper evaluation. Students interested in Honors with Distinction are encouraged to start working on their thesis/project a year prior to graduation.
