Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science
Department of Mechanical Engineering
Overview

The objective of the Bachelor of Science degree program in Mechanical Engineering is to produce Mechanical Engineering graduates who will be capable of undertaking challenging projects that require knowledge of the fundamentals and design of mechanical and thermal systems. The program seeks to build Mechanical Engineers to meet the needs of analysis, design, and development in industry, as well as to educate them to be innovators and policy makers. The BS degree program will provide the necessary training and education for future engineers who will effectively identify new problems and develop innovative solutions, including new manufacturing and fabrication technologies.

Mechanical Engineering (BS)
Program Educational Objectives for Mechanical Engineering

One broad goal for the Erik Jonsson School is to provide an excellent education for our students. Within a few years after graduation, graduates of the Mechanical Engineering Program should:

Be on a successful career path as competent professionals in their chosen field or by pursuing advanced study.
Serve their professional roles in a responsible and ethical manner to meet the needs of engineering and society.
Be effective contributors or leaders in professional settings, including contributions to multidisciplinary teams.
Actively pursue life-long learning through advanced education, self-study, professional development, etc.
High School Preparation

Engineering education requires a strong high school preparation. Pre-engineering students should have high school preparation of at least one-half year in trigonometry and at least one year in elementary algebra, intermediate and advanced algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, chemistry, and physics, thus developing their competencies to the highest possible levels and preparing to move immediately into demanding college courses in calculus, calculus-based physics, and chemistry for science majors. It is also essential that pre- engineering students have the competence of reading comprehension, and to write logically, clearly and correctly.

ABET Accreditation

The BS program in Mechanical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.

Lower-Division Study

All lower-division students in Mechanical Engineering concentrate on mathematics, science, and introductory engineering courses, building competence in these cornerstone areas for future application in upper-division engineering courses. The following requirements apply both to students seeking to transfer to UT Dallas from other institutions as well as to those currently enrolled at UT Dallas, whether in another school or in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science.

Academic Progress in Mechanical Engineering

In order to make satisfactory academic progress as a Mechanical Engineering major, a student must meet all University requirements for academic progress, and must earn a grade of C- or better in each of the "major requirements" courses. No "Major Requirements" course may be taken until the student has obtained a grade of C- or better in each of the prerequisites. If a higher grade requirement is stated for a specific class, the higher requirement applies.

III. Elective Requirements: 3 semester credit hours

Free Electives: 3 semester credit hours

Both lower- and upper-division courses may count as free electives.

Degree programs in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science are governed by various accreditation boards that place restrictions on classes used to meet the curricular requirements of degrees they certify. For this reason, not all classes offered by the University can be used to meet elective requirements. Please check with your academic advisor before enrolling in classes you hope to use as free electives.

The plan must include sufficient upper-division courses to total 45 upper-division semester credit hours.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

In response to the need for advanced education in Mechanical Engineering, a Fast Track program is available to well-qualified UT Dallas undergraduate students. Qualified seniors may take up to 15 graduate semester credit hours that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy the requirements for the master's degree. This is accomplished by (1) taking courses (typically electives) during one or more summer semesters, and (2) beginning graduate coursework during the senior year. Details are available from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education.

Honors Program

The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers upper-division Honors for outstanding students in the BS Mechanical Engineering degree program. This program offers special sections of designated classes and other activities designed to enhance the educational experience of exceptional students. Admission to the Honors programs requires a 3.500 or better GPA (grade point average) in at least 30 semester credit hours of coursework. Graduation with Honors requires a 3.500 or better GPA and completion of at least 6 honors classes. These honors classes must include either MECH 4399 or MECH 4V98 and a Senior Honors Thesis must be completed within one of those two classes. While the topics may be related, the Senior Thesis does not replace the need for the student to complete a regular Senior Design Project. The other 5 honors classes can come from a mixture of Graduate level (up to a count of 4) classes and special honor sections of regular undergraduate MECH classes (up to a count of 2).

Departmental Honors with Distinction may be awarded to students whose Senior Honors Thesis is judged by a faculty committee to be of exemplary quality. Only students graduating with Departmental Honors are eligible. Thesis/projects must be submitted by the deadline that applies to MS Theses in the graduating semester to allow for proper evaluation. Students interested in Honors with Distinction are encouraged to start working on their thesis/project a year prior to graduation.

Minors

The Department of Mechanical Engineering does not offer minors at this time.

1. Semester credit hours fulfill the communication component of the Core Curriculum.

2. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted under Mathematics Core, and five semester credit hours of Calculus are counted as Component Area Option Core.

3. MATH 2417 and MATH 2419 requirements can be fulfilled by completing MATH 2413, MATH 2414, and MATH 2415, as is commonly done when enrollment prerequisites for MATH 2417 are not met. Students who take MATH 2413, MATH 2414, and MATH 2415 may request three additional semester credit hours of Mathematics be applied to fulfill Free Elective credit requirements and may petition that one additional credit hour of Mathematics be applied to fulfill Technical Elective credit requirements.

4. Six semester credit hours of Physics are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics (PHYS 2125) is counted as Component Area Option Core.

5. Students must pass each of the "Major Requirements" courses listed in this degree plan and each of their prerequisites, with a grade of C- or better.

6. Transfer students with sufficient background may petition to substitute upper-division semester credit hours in the major for this class.
