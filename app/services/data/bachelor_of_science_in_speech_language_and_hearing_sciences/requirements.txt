School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences
Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences (BS)

The Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences program offers study in the processes and disorders of speech, language, and hearing. The program provides the foundation for graduate studies in speech-language pathology, audiology, or speech, language, and hearing sciences. For those not pursuing graduate education, the degree also provides initial preparation for assistant certification and alternate careers in health care.

The curriculum in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences focuses on the development of communicative abilities; the anatomical and physiological mechanisms underlying speech, language, and hearing; the causes of communication disorders in children and adults; and theories and techniques of assessment and treatment of communication disorders.

The program offers three areas of focus: speech-language pathology, audiology, and speech, language, and hearing science. All majors take a sequence of core courses followed by electives specific to their interests and career goals. Electives should be chosen based on careful review of the course descriptions provided in the catalog and in consultation with their academic advisor.

Students who plan to attend graduate school in speech-language pathology or audiology should be aware that clinical certification by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association requires that students complete at least one course in each of the following subject areas: Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences (chemistry or physics is required), Behavioral Sciences (e.g. psychology, sociology), and a stand-alone Statistics course. Completion of this coursework prior to applying to graduate school is strongly advised.

Students who wish to combine Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences with Psychology, Neuroscience, or Child Learning and Development should be able to meet requirements in both majors, and, with the approval of the Associate Dean, complete a double major. Students considering a double major should consult with their advisor regarding specific requirements. Students can complete Core Curriculum and Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences major requirements in a minimum of 78 semester credit hours, leaving 42 elective semester credit hours.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

UT Dallas undergraduate students with strong academic records who intend to pursue a master's degree in Speech Language Pathology at the University may consider an accelerated undergraduate-graduate plan of study. If accepted into the program, students may take up to 15 semester credit hours of graduate courses that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy requirements for the master's degree. Students must maintain a 3.000 grade point average and earn grades of B or better in graduate courses taken.

Students should apply for Fast Track admission in the semester they reach 90 semester credit hours. To qualify for application, undergraduate students must have completed at least 18 semester credit hours in major core courses at UT Dallas. To be eligible for Fast Track admission, students must have completed at least 90 semester credit hours toward a baccalaureate degree, completed at least 36 hours of the general education core curriculum, and meet program admission requirements, including submission of GRE scores. Apply to the Fast Track program through the graduate Speech Language Pathology program, not through Enrollment Services. Students should consult with a graduate advisor regarding admissions criteria and plans of study. Admission into the Speech Language Pathology Fast Track program is highly selective requiring a strong academic record and demonstrated readiness for graduate education.

Minors

Students must complete 18 semester credit hours including 9 required semester credit hours of foundation coursework and 9 semester credit hours of guided electives. At least 12 semester credit hours must be upper-division courses, of which at least 9 semester credit hours must have been completed at UT Dallas.

Minor in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences

18 semester credit hours

Students interested in communication sciences and disorders may elect to minor in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences. Students complete 18 semester credit hours including 12 required semester credit hours of foundation coursework and 6 elective semester credit hours. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). No semester credit hours may be used to satisfy both major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor. At least one-third of the semester credit hours for a minor must be taken at UT Dallas.

Students majoring in Psychology, Neuroscience, or Cognitive Science, or students with interests in the health sciences may find that a minor in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences adds a valuable interdisciplinary dimension to their overall plan of study and may enhance their opportunities for graduate study.
