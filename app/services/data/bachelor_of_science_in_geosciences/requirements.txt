School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics
Department of Sustainable Earth Systems Sciences
Geosciences (BS)

Attaining a fundamental understanding of Earth's natural systems, past and present, and their coupled nonlinear relationships, is a primary goal of geosciences. An earth scientist studies the Earth's structure, composition and evolution, its minerals, rocks, fossils, sediments and fluids, and investigates the geological, physical, and biogeochemical processes occurring within the Earth and on its surface.

Professional career opportunities in earth sciences are available in the environmental, energy, mineral, and groundwater resource industries, and in government, educational, and research organizations related to these fields. In addition, many occupations concerned with business, management, economics, law, policy, and engineering, require a background in earth sciences.

Specific degree plans will be formulated by the undergraduate advisor in the Department of Sustainable Earth Systems Sciences. Changing circumstances may require changes to the degree plans.

Teaching Option degrees require deep content knowledge combined with courses grounded in the latest research on math and science education. While most graduates go on to classroom teaching, UTeach alums are also prepared to enter graduate school and to work in a discipline related industry.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

An accelerated BS/MS Fast Track Program is available for undergraduate students with strong academic records who intend to pursue master's studies at UT Dallas. After Fast Track admission to an MS program, students may take up to 15 semester credit hours of approved graduate courses in their senior year to use toward completion of both the BS and MS degrees. Students must have completed 90 or more semester credit hours (out of which 36 hours are from the core curriculum), with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00. In addition, students must have completed CHEM 1311 and CHEM 1312 with labs, MATH 2413 and MATH 2414, and PHYS 2325 and PHYS 2326 with labs; or equivalent courses.

Interested students, after reviewing the UT Dallas Fast Track policy, should contact their undergraduate advisor and the graduate advisor of the intended MS program.

Minors

Students must take a minimum of 18 semester credit hours for the minor, 12 of which must be upper-division semester credit hours. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). Semester credit hours may not be used to satisfy both the major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor.

For all minors in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics students must complete all prerequisite sequences for required minor courses.
