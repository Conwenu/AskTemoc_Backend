Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Media Arts and Design (BA)

This general degree plan emphasizes the breadth of the major's interdisciplinary programs, which allows students to explore early courses across the curriculum. This offers students an opportunity to explore the foundation courses in which they will develop the experience and materials needed before choosing whether to apply to specialize in a concentration with greater depth in Critical Media Studies or Emerging Media Art.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Media Arts and Design are open to all students in the University. However, students majoring in Media Arts and Design may be given preference in certain course enrollments.
