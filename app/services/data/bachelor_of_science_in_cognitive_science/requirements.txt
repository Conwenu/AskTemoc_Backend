Cognitive Science (BS)

Cognitive Science is the study of complex information processing in humans and machines and includes the multidisciplinary study of biological and artificial systems. Important components of cognitive science include areas of research such as: cognitive-neuroscience, brain-imaging studies of perceptual and cognitive processing, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, computational neuroscience, and mathematical psychology. The field of cognitive science draws from diverse approaches to understanding complex information processing systems, including research from experimental psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.

The Cognitive Science program in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at UT Dallas consists of four concentration areas: (1) Psychology, (2) Neuroscience, (3) Human-Computer Interaction, and (4) Intelligent Systems (AI)/Computational Modeling.

Cognitive Science Majors select core upper-division coursework from 2 of these 4 concentration areas to generate multidisciplinary areas of focus. In addition to providing a sound preparation for graduate work in Cognitive Science and related areas, the Cognitive Science major is an ideal choice for students pursuing careers that combine interests in neuroscience, cognition, mathematics, and computer science. There are exciting career prospects in both industry and academics for the Cognitive Science major.

Cognitive-Neuroscience Careers. Students whose focus area is cognitive-neuroscience will be well prepared for the pursuit of graduate degrees and careers associated with: medicine, clinical neuropsychology, brain-imaging technology, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, and evaluation of bionic/prosthetic technology (e.g., cochlear implants and artificial limbs). Students interested in Cognitive-Neuroscience career opportunities typically choose their coursework from the concentration areas of both Psychology and Neuroscience.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Careers. The areas of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are concerned with the problem of the design and evaluation of artificially intelligent systems. Examples of artificially intelligent systems include: web search engines, speech recognition algorithms, computer-based natural language understanding, robotics, computer vision, smart algorithms which support automatized data mining, the design of intelligent entities in computer games, as well as bionic and prosthetic technology development and evaluation (such as cochlear implant technology). Students interested in career opportunities in this area should choose their core coursework from the AI/Computational Modeling concentration area and one of the other three concentration areas.

Computational Neuroscience and Mathematical Psychology Careers. Computational neuroscience and mathematical psychology are areas of study concerned with the development of mathematical and simulation models for the purpose of advancing theory in the behavioral and brain sciences. Students interested in careers in computational neuroscience would choose their core coursework from the concentration areas of both Neuroscience and AI/Computational Modeling. Students interested in the area of mathematical psychology would choose their core coursework from the AI/Computational Modeling concentration area and one of the other three concentration areas.

Usability Engineering and User Experience (UX) Careers. Students whose focus area is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), are prepared to pursue careers in the areas of usability engineering and user-experience (UX) design. Such careers involve the evaluation and design of human-computer interfaces such as website and software graphical user interfaces (GUIs), smartphone interfaces, and voice-user interfaces (VUIs). Students interested in Usability Engineering and User Experience (UX) Research opportunities should choose their core coursework from the Psychology/HCI concentration area and include one or more HCI courses. Students interested in the area of user-experience (UX) design typically choose their core coursework from the concentration areas of Human-Computer Interaction and Psychology.

Medical and Dental School Career Paths. The Cognitive Science major is an excellent choice for students interested in preparation for medical or dental graduate study. Cognitive science students receive training in areas such as biology, chemistry, psychology, and mathematics. Freshman and sophomore students interested in pre-med careers should identify basic, required, and recommended subject requirements for their top choices in medical schools. This information should then be used to design an appropriate cognitive science curriculum with their undergraduate Cognitive Science advisor. Students interested in Health Services career paths should choose the Neuroscience concentration area and one of the other three concentration areas.

III. Elective Requirements: 15-29 semester credit hours

Free Electives: 15-29 semester credit hours

Students are encouraged to explore areas of concentration in Cognitive Science, Psychology, and Neuroscience as well as explore interests outside the field. In addition, advanced CGS students in good academic standing may request permission from the Cognitive Science Program Head to take graduate Applied Cognition and Neuroscience coursework (ACN prefix) to fulfill some of the elective course requirements.

The plan must include sufficient upper-division courses to total 45 upper-division semester credit hours.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

UT Dallas undergraduate students with strong academic records who intend to pursue a master's degree in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience at UT Dallas may consider an accelerated undergraduate-graduate plan of study. If accepted into the program, students may take up to 15 semester credit hours of graduate courses that may be used to complete the bachelor's degree and also to satisfy requirements for the Master's degree. Students must maintain a 3.000 grade point average and earn grades of B or better in the graduate courses taken.

Students should apply for Fast Track admission in the semester they reach 90 semester credit hours. To qualify for application, undergraduate students must have completed at least 18 semester credit hours in major core courses at UT Dallas. To be eligible for Fast Track admission, students must have completed at least 90 semester credit hours toward a baccalaureate degree, completed a minimum of 36 hours of general education core curriculum classes, and meet program admission requirements. Apply to the Fast Track program through the Applied Cognition and Neuroscience Program Office. Students should consult with a graduate advisor regarding admissions criteria and plans of study at the beginning of their junior year.

Minors

Students must complete 18 semester credit hours including 9 required semester credit hours of foundation coursework and 9 semester credit hours of guided electives. At least 12 semester credit hours must be upper-division courses, of which at least 9 semester credit hours must have been completed at UT Dallas.

Minor in Cognitive Science

18 semester credit hours

Students who are not majoring in Cognitive Science may minor in Cognitive Science by completing 18 semester credit hours. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). At least 12 of the 18 semester credit hours required by the minor in Cognitive Science must be satisfied by completing four upper-division courses from one of the three different Cognitive Science concentration areas. In addition, 9 of the 18 semester credit hours required for the minor in Cognitive Science must have a Cognitive Science (CGS), Psychology (PSY), or Neuroscience (NSC) prefix and be upper-division courses. No semester credit hours may be used to satisfy both major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor. At least one-third of the semester credit hours for a minor must be taken at UT Dallas.

1. A required Preparatory course that also fulfills a Core Curriculum requirement. Fourteen semester credit hours (14) are counted in Core Curriculum.

2. Enrollment in CS 1337 requires students to either obtain a score of at least a 70% on the CS Placement Exam or complete CS 1436 with a grade of C or higher.

3. Note that either SE 3341 or STAT 3341 may be used as an equivalent course for CS 3341 for all Cognitive Science program requirements as well as all Cognitive Science course prerequisites.

4. Taught only once every other year.
