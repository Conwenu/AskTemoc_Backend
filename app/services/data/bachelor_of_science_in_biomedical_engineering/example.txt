NOTES:
1	Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2	Semester credit hours fulfill the communication component of the Core Curriculum.
3	Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted under Mathematics Core, and five semester credit hours of Calculus are counted as Component Area Option Core.
4	Six semester credit hours of Physics are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics (PHYS 2125) is counted as Component Area Option Core.
5	Students must pass each of the major requirement courses listed in this degree plan and each of their prerequisites, with a grade of C- or better.
6	Transfer students with sufficient background may petition to substitute upper-division semester credit hours in the major for this class.
7	Earliest semester course can be taken due to pre- or co-requisite course requirements.
8	Must complete by 3rd semester of enrollment.
9	For students completing MATH Sequence II (MATH 2413, MATH 2414, and MATH 2415), a summer term is not essential for a timely completion of degree. See Academic Advisor for details.

Students wishing to fast track into the graduate program in Biomedical Engineering may take up to six (6) semester credit hours of graduate BMEN electives - see the Undergraduate ECS Advising Office or the Degree Plan Evaluator in BMEN, for specific fast-track courses. Cumulative GPA of 3.00 minimum required for Fast-Track Program. See Academic Advisor for other requirements.

Be sure to check prerequisites of 2000-level or higher courses.
