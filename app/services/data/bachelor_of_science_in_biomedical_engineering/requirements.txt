Mission of the Department of Bioengineering

The mission of the Bioengineering Department is to provide a state-of-the-art, highly interdisciplinary, teaching and research environment for undergraduate and graduate students. Whether at undergraduate or post-graduate levels, our students will be able to reach across traditional disciplinary boundaries, and work effectively with experts in engineering, life sciences, and medicine. At the Bachelors level, our graduates will be ready to meet the rapidly growing demand for bioengineers, and tackle challenges in emerging areas, including but not limited to personalized medicine, biomedical devices, and targeted drug delivery. At the Masters and PhD levels, our graduates will undertake original cutting-edge research at the forefront of scientific and technological developments in bioengineering.

High School Preparation

Engineering education requires a strong high school preparation. Pre-engineering students should have high school preparation of at least one-half year in trigonometry and at least one year each in algebra, pre-calculus, plane geometry, chemistry, and physics, thus developing their competencies to the highest possible levels and preparing to move immediately into demanding college courses in calculus, calculus-based physics, and chemistry for science majors. It is also essential that pre- engineering students have the competence to read rapidly and with comprehension, and to write clearly and correctly.

Lower-Division Study

All lower-division students in Biomedical Engineering concentrate on mathematics, science, and introductory engineering courses, building competence in these cornerstone areas for future application in upper-division engineering courses. The following requirements apply both to students seeking to transfer to UT Dallas from other institutions as well as to those currently enrolled at UT Dallas, whether in another school or in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science.

Academic Progress in Biomedical Engineering

In order to make satisfactory academic progress as a Biomedical Engineering major, a student must meet all University requirements for academic progress, and must earn a grade of C- or better in each of the "major requirements" courses. No "Major Requirement" course may be taken until the student has obtained a grade of C- or better in each of the prerequisites. If a higher grade requirement is stated for a specific class, the higher requirement applies.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

In response to the need for advanced education in Biomedical engineering, a Fast Track program is available to well-qualified UT Dallas undergraduate students. Qualified seniors may take up to 15 graduate semester credit hours that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy the requirements for the master's degree. This is accomplished by (1) taking courses (typically electives) during one or more summer semesters, and (2) beginning graduate coursework during the senior year. Details are available from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education.

Honors Program

The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers upper-division Honors for outstanding students in the BS Biomedical Engineering degree program. This program offers special sections of designated classes and other activities designed to enhance the educational experience of exceptional students. Admission to the Honors programs requires a 3.500 or better GPA in at least 30 semester credit hours of coursework.

Graduation with Honors requires a 3.500 or better GPA and completion of at least 6 honors classes. These honors classes must include either BMEN 4399 or BMEN 4V98 and a Senior Honors Thesis must be completed within one of those two classes. While the topics may be related, the Senior Thesis does not replace the need for the student to complete a regular Senior Design Project. The other 5 honors classes can come from a mixture of Graduate level (up to a count of 4) classes and special honor sections of regular undergraduate BMEN classes (up to a count of 2).

Departmental Honors with Distinction may be awarded to students whose Senior Honors Thesis is judged by a faculty committee to be of exemplary quality. Only students graduating with Departmental Honors are eligible. Thesis/projects must be submitted by the deadline that applies to MS Theses in the graduating semester to allow for proper evaluation. Students interested in Honors with Distinction are encouraged to start working on their thesis/project a year prior to graduation.

Considerations for Pre-Med Students

While the Department of Bioengineering does not have an official track for pre-med students, a suggested course sequence is available to guide pre-med students in selecting complementary coursework. It is critical that students interested in medical school meet with their advisor to ensure their biology and chemistry courses will meet the requirements for medical schools.

Minors

The Department of Bioengineering does not offer minors at this time.

1. Semester credit hours fulfill the communication component of the Core Curriculum.

2. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted under Mathematics Core, and five semester credit hours of Calculus are counted as Component Area Option Core.

3. Six semester credit hours of Physics are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics (PHYS 2125) is counted as Component Area Option Core.

4. Students must pass each of the major requirement courses listed in this degree plan and each of their prerequisites, with a grade of C- or better.

5. Transfer students with sufficient background may petition to substitute upper-division semester credit hours in the major for this class.
