Economics (BA, BS)

Economists study how people make choices in life when scarcity limits what is available and provides incentives to induce efficient behavior. They examine individual decisions of consumers and profit maximization within firms; a society's financial, industrial, and labor organizations; its distribution of income and ownership rights; its governmental activities; and its political and economic philosophies, and analyze how these and other factors influence the goods an economy produces, the resources it uses in production, and the distribution of its output. They also look at how incentives affect decisions relating to human behavior, such as whether to obey the law, get married, or have children.

Economic analysis leads to explanations, predictions, and policy suggestions. How do firms maximize profits and use pricing schemes to differentiate markers? How are wages and prices set? How do firms select inputs in order to minimize costs? Why do we have a financial crisis? How should we use our natural resources? How will consumers and corporations react to a tax cut? What are the drivers of terrorism and how does this inform counter-terror policy? In order to protect consumers, what antitrust and government regulations should be enforced? What can be done to reduce inflation and unemployment? To prevent excess pollution? To achieve economic growth? To distribute income more equitably? In examining these sorts of questions, economics helps us to understand more clearly the choices available to us and the consequences of our decisions.

There is an abundance of career opportunities for an economics major.

Careers in business include pricing, market analysis, consulting, data analytics, banking and other financial institutions, insurance, corporate strategic planning, real estate, management, and marketing.

Careers in government include federal reserve banks, publicly owned utilities, planning and forecasting, regulatory agencies, management, needs assessment, legislative staffs, judicial agencies, and executive support.

Careers in the interfacing of business and government include labor arbitration, regulation, environmental planning, urban and regional planning, and interest representation.

Economics is an excellent preparation for a career in law.
