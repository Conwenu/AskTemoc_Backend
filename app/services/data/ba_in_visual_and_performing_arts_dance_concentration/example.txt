NOTES:
1	Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2	Students completing the 020 requirement with a MATH course must complete ALEKS exam prior to enrollment. PHIL 2303 does not require the ALEKS exam.

NOTE: If the student took DANC 1310 or DANC 1305 as their core, then the student may choose any free elective in its place as a lower-level major requirement.
4	Major Core - 12 semester credit hours - VPAS 3340, VPAS 4389, (VPAS 4390 or VPAS 4V99), and 3 semester credit hours of upper-level Related Courses from AHTC (excluding the DANC prefix).
