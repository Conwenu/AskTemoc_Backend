Biochemistry (BS)

The Biochemistry program at UT Dallas, administered through the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, draws on faculty from the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, and researchers from UT Southwestern Medical School to provide courses and research opportunities to its majors. The Biochemistry major bridges the gap between modern Chemistry and Biology. The curriculum, designed to prepare students for either graduate work in the Biological Sciences, the Chemical Sciences, or for entry-level positions in the biotechnology industry, builds on a base of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics to provide the student the opportunity to develop essential theoretical and practical skills.

UT Southwestern Medical School

UT Dallas Biochemistry majors may perform their research in the laboratories of faculty members from the departments of Biochemistry, Internal Medicine, Pharmacology and Physiology at UT Southwestern, as available.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

For students with strong academic record who intend to pursue master's studies at UT Dallas, accelerated BS/MS Fast Tracks are available. After Fast Track admission to an MS program, students may take up to 15 semester credit hours of approved graduate courses in their senior year to use toward completion of both the BS and MS degrees. The available Fast Track options and their admission requirements, if any, in addition to having completed 90 or more semester credit hours (out of which 36 hours are from the core curriculum) with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00, are as follows:

MS in Chemistry
MS in Biotechnology: Students must have a GPA of at least 3.20 and have completed BIOL 2311, BIOL 2312, and BIOL 2281, or equivalent courses.
MS in Molecular and Cell Biology: Students must have a GPA of at least 3.20 and have completed BIOL 2311, BIOL 2312, and BIOL 2281, or equivalent courses.
MS in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology: Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.
MS in Data Science and Statistics: (Only Data Science and Applied Statistics specializations) Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.

Interested students, after reviewing the UT Dallas Fast Track policy, should contact their undergraduate advisor and the graduate advisor of the intended MS program well in advance of their junior year to prepare a course sequence permitting maximal advantage and apply to the Fast Track program.

1. A required Major course that also fulfills Core Curriculum requirement. Semester credit hours are counted in the Core Curriculum.

2. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted to fulfill the Mathematics Core Requirement with the remaining one semester credit hour to be counted under Component Area Option Core.

3. Six semester credit hours of Chemistry are counted under Science core, and one semester of Physics (PHYS 2125) are counted under Component Area Option core.

4. Students may use PHYS 2421 as part of the component area core curriculum requirement instead of PHYS 2125 if they choose that Physics sequence.

5. Indicates a prerequisite class to be completed before enrolling for upper-division classes.

6. Students will take one of the two Physics sequences: PHYS 2325 and PHYS 2326 or PHYS 2421 and PHYS 2422 with accompanying labs.

7. Students who complete PHYS 2421 do not need to complete PHYS 2125.
