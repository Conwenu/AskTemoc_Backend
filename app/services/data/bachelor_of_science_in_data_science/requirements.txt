School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics
Data Science (BS)

The Data Science BS is jointly offered by the Department of Mathematical Sciences in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and the Department of Computer Science in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science. Data Science is an emerging discipline that lies at the intersection of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics. The curriculum for the program provides a solid foundation in all the three disciplines. It prepares students for Data Scientist or related positions in industry, business, and government that are currently in high demand and also for graduate study in either of the three disciplines. The curriculum also includes a capstone project course.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

For students with strong academic record who intend to pursue master's studies at UT Dallas, accelerated BS/MS Fast Tracks are available. After Fast Track admission to an MS program, students may take up to 15 semester credit hours of approved graduate courses in their senior year to use toward completion of both the BS and MS degrees. The available Fast Track options and their admission requirements, in addition to having completed 90 or more semester credit hours (out of which 36 hours are from the core curriculum) with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00, are as follows:

MS in Mathematics (Data Science specialization and possibly other specializations10): Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.
MS in Statistics: Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.

Interested students, after reviewing the UT Dallas Fast Track policy, should contact their undergraduate advisor and the graduate advisor of the intended MS program well in advance of their junior year to prepare a course sequence permitting maximal advantage and apply to the Fast Track program.
