School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences
Public Affairs (BS)

The Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs is intended for individuals called upon to manage in the arenas of government, nonprofits, or business. These generalist managers must synthesize many forms of knowledge derived from government, economics, sociology, and other fields, and must apply that knowledge creatively to meet the varied and multiple challenges of public administration. The ability to understand the substance of policy and program issues; the ability to grasp the administrative, political, and ethical implications embedded in them; and the ability then to act upon the issues with effect, together define the worth of contemporary managers. Students develop an understanding of the political, economic, and social factors that influence decision-making in government and nonprofit organizations.

The Public Affairs program promotes the acquisition of knowledge and skills essential to the tasks of identification, analysis, design implementation, supervision, evaluation, communication, and other key functions that are integral components of management careers in federal, state, and local governments; criminal justice; social service, education, community development, arts, and other nonprofit organizations; and business firms.
