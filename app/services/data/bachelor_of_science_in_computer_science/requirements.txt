Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science
Department of Computer Science
Computer Science (BS)

The Computer Science Department offers the BS degree in Computer Science and the BS degree in Software Engineering. Both are based on a solid foundation of mathematics, including calculus, and discrete mathematics. These programs of study are designed to offer students opportunities to prepare for an industrial, business, or governmental career in a rapidly changing profession and to prepare for graduate study in a field in which further education is strongly recommended. The two programs have the same basis in core computer science, including the analysis of algorithms and data structures, modern programming methodologies, and the study of operating systems. The Computer Science program continues with courses in advanced data structures, programming languages, telecommunications networks, and automata theory, while the Software Engineering program includes courses in requirements engineering, software validation and testing, and software architecture, culminating in a challenging project course in which students must demonstrate use of software engineering techniques. Both programs offer a rich choice of elective studies, including courses in artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and compiler design.

The school offers a "fast track" BS/MS option; see Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degree Program.

The Computer Science Department and the Department of Mathematical Sciences in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics jointly offer a BS degree in Data Science.

Mission of the Department of Computer Science

The mission of the Department of Computer Science is to prepare undergraduate and graduate students for productive careers in industry, academia, and government by providing an outstanding environment for teaching, learning, and research in the theory and applications of computing. The Department places a high priority on establishing and maintaining innovative research programs to enhance its education quality and make it an important regional, national, and international resource center for discovering, integrating, and applying new knowledge and technologies.

Goals for the Computer Science Program

The undergraduate Computer Science program is committed to providing students with a high-quality education and preparing them for long and successful careers in industry and government.

Our graduates, while eminently ready for immediate employment, will also be fully ready for focused training as required for specific positions in Computer Science and closely related areas. Graduates interested in highly technical careers, research, and/or academia will be fully prepared to further their education in graduate school.

Program Educational Objectives for Computer Science

Within a few years after graduation, graduates of the Computer Science program should:

Pursue lasting and successful careers in computer science or related fields including as industry professionals, educators, researchers, government professionals and/or entrepreneurs
Be effective team contributors and/or leaders, including in multi-disciplinary environments, in professional fields related to computer science
Serve their profession in a socially responsible, ethical, and innovative manner to meet the software engineering needs of industry, academia, and/or society
Continue to develop and grow through lifelong learning, and successfully adapt to continuous advancements in software technology

Interested students should see the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education (ADU) for specific requirements.

Honors Programs

The Department of Computer Science offers an Honors Program called Computer Science Computing Scholars (CS2). (CS2) is an intense Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Degree Program created for exceptionally gifted students who wish to pursue a demanding course of study enriched throughout with research experiences. The Computing Scholars Program has a specially designed curriculum. Courses integrate discussion of current research, recent discoveries, and open problems into a rich logical progression of firmly related topics. Course numbers for the Core Curriculum Requirements and Major Requirements are the same as those for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, but Computing Scholars take honors versions of the following courses: CS 1200, CS 2305, CS 2340, CS 3341, CS 3345, CS 3354, CS 4141, CS 4337, CS 4341, CS 4348, CS 4349, and CS 4384.

Admission to the program is mainly by nomination and invitation. Those invited to join the Computing Scholars Honors Program will have successfully completed a full and challenging high school curriculum, will have achieved high scores on the SAT or ACT tests, and will be about to graduate from high school, or equivalent, with high class rank.

Successful participants will graduate with the added distinction of a Computing Scholars Honors Diploma.
