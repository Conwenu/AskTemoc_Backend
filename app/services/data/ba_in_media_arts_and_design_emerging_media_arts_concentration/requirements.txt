Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Media Arts and Design (BA) with Emerging Media Arts Concentration

This Concentration offers students coursework in digital arts areas such as digital fabrication, projection mapping, new media art and performance, sound, time-based media, and video. EMA Concentration students will have the opportunity to engage in studio art practices with emerging media and technology. The EMA Concentration centers on building a portfolio of studio-based artwork as part of the ongoing social role that art plays in reimagining and projecting the human condition. By selecting courses from a variety of School elective headings, students are able to synthesize other areas of interest into their focus on Emerging Media Arts.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Media Arts and Design are open to all students in the University. However, students majoring in Media Arts and Design may be given preference in certain course enrollments.
