Criminology (BA)

The Criminology Program is an interdisciplinary academic program, based primarily in criminology and sociology that studies the interrelationships among law, policy, and societal conditions. The relationships among these factors are dynamic and complex, therefore Criminology integrates a variety of perspectives, approaches, and social science disciplines in order to analyze and understand the origins of crime and injustice and society's response to these issues.

Mission Statement

The mission of the Criminology Program is to examine the causes and consequences of crime and crime control politics by providing a program of study involving a variety of perspectives, approaches, and social science disciplines to undergraduate students. Our faculty members are dedicated teachers and scholars who have published their work in the most prestigious journals in the field. They are committed to expanding the knowledge of the discipline and preparing students to be leaders in influencing our society's response to crime.
