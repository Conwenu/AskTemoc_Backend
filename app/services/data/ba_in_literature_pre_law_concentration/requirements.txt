Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Literature (BA) with Pre-Law Concentration

Students who complete the major in Literature receive a thorough grounding in literary ideas and methods, competence in particular national literatures, as well as the ability to work across literatures and languages. By engaging literary works appropriate to one of the country's most diverse campuses, this major teaches both specialized knowledge and the skills to deepen and broaden knowledge of literature that is new or unfamiliar. The ideal graduate would be able to approach English-language literary works from anywhere in the world with a set of intelligent questions and the capacity to produce equally intelligent solutions to interpretative problems. By selecting a variety of courses from a variety of headings, students are able to combine courses in criticism and interpretation, in writing and translation, and in English and foreign languages. Students may also pursue teaching certification.

The study of literature in general--with its emphasis on writing, close reading, and textual interpretation--already helps students to develop many of the core skills that they will need to succeed in law school. Students in the Pre-Law Concentration receive the same rigorous training in literary studies as all Literature majors but they complete, in addition, a selection of law-related courses that help them not only to better understand the law but also to sharpen the research, writing, and analytical skills that they will need in legal careers.

At least one-half of the semester credit hours for the major must be taken at UT Dallas.
