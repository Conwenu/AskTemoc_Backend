School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences
Political Science (BA)

Political Science involves the study of interesting and important topics about citizenship, government and politics. These topics include the influence of citizens on what government does, the scope, responsibilities and effectiveness of government itself, and the activities of both elected and appointed public officials. These topics are important parts of what political scientists know about American government and politics, comparative government and politics, international relations, political behavior, political economy, political institutions, and political theory. Political scientists and public administrators pay particular attention to the design, implementation, and evaluation of laws and public policies that may affect people's well-being.

The Political Science Program at The University of Texas at Dallas provides:

the foundations for more advanced, graduate study of citizenship, government and politics in Political Science;
the special core knowledge needed for subsequent professional education in law and public policy analysis;
the opportunity to acquire useful skills for careers in federal, state, and local government, community service, educational and other nonprofit organizations, and business firms.
