Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science
Interdisciplinary Programs

The Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Science program in Computer Engineering. This program is delivered by the combined faculties of the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.

Computer Engineering (BS)

The Computer Engineering program is interdisciplinary. It was designed by the combined faculties of the Computer Science Department and the Electrical Engineering Department. Computer Engineering requires a blend of knowledge from the areas of hardware (Electrical Engineering) and software (Computer Science). The focus of the Computer Engineering degree is to provide an excellent education in modern computer systems and prepare its graduates for outstanding careers in the rapidly changing and growing profession and for further continuing education.

The Computer Engineering program is based on a solid foundation of science and mathematics coursework. Students have opportunities to expand their abilities to analyze and solve complex problems and to design new uses of technology to serve society. This program provides an integrated educational experience directed toward the development of the ability to apply pertinent knowledge to the identification and solution of practical problems in computer engineering.

The Computer Engineering curriculum ensures that the design experience, which includes both analytical and experimental studies, is integrated throughout in a sequential development leading to advanced work. Design problems are frequently assigned in both lecture and laboratory courses. Each student is required to complete a major design project during the senior year. In addition, internships and cooperative education programs with area companies may further supplement a student's design experiences.

Mission of the Computer Engineering (CE) Program

The mission of the Computer Engineering Program is to provide an excellent education in modern computer engineering practice. Our graduates are highly qualified for rewarding and successful careers in a diverse range of computer engineering fields.

Program Educational Objectives for Computer Engineering

The UT Dallas Computer Engineering Program educational objectives will enable our graduates within a few years of graduation to:

Successfully pursue a diverse range of careers as computer engineers, consultants, educators, and/or entrepreneurs as well as pursue advanced education.
Be effective contributors and leaders in both professional and personal settings.
Serve their profession and/or employer in a responsible, ethical, creative, and enthusiastic manner to meet the needs of industry and society
Continue to learn and improve through self-motivation.
High School Preparation

Engineering education requires a strong high school preparation. Pre-engineering students should have high school preparation of at least one-half year in trigonometry and at least one year each in elementary algebra, intermediate and advanced algebra, plane geometry, chemistry, and physics, thus developing their competencies to the highest possible levels and preparing them to move immediately into demanding college courses in calculus, calculus-based physics, and chemistry for science majors. Pre-Computer Engineering students should have some experience with elementary programming in a high level language such as C, C++, or Java. It is also essential that pre-engineering students have the competence to read rapidly and with comprehension, and to write clearly and correctly.

Lower-Division Study

All lower-division students in Computer Engineering concentrate on mathematics, science, and introductory engineering courses, building competence in these cornerstone areas for future application in upper-division engineering courses. The following requirements apply both to students seeking to transfer to UT Dallas from other institutions as well as to those currently enrolled at UT Dallas, whether in another school or in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science.

ABET Accreditation

The BS program in Computer Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.

Academic Progress in Computer Engineering

In order to make satisfactory academic progress as a Computer Engineering major, a student must meet all University requirements for academic progress, and must earn a grade of C- or better in each of the "major requirements" courses. No "Major Requirements" course (as listed under Section II of the BS degree requirement) may be taken until the student has obtained a grade of C- or better in each of the prerequisites (if a higher grade requirement is stated for a specific class, the higher requirement applies).

III. Elective Requirements: 0-4 semester credit hours

Free Electives: 0-4 semester credit hours

Students who take MATH sequence I will not have any free electives.
Students who take MATH sequence II take 4 semester credit hours of free electives.

The plan must include sufficient upper-division courses to total 45 upper-division semester credit hours.

Degree programs in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science are governed by various accreditation boards that place restrictions on classes used to meet the curricular requirements of degrees they certify. For this reason, not all classes offered by the University can be used to meet elective requirements. Please check with your academic advisor before enrolling in classes you hope to use as free electives.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

In response to the need for advanced education in computer engineering, a Fast Track program is available to well-qualified UT Dallas undergraduate students. Qualified seniors may take up to 15 graduate semester credit hours that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy the requirements for the master's degree. This is accomplished by (1) taking courses (typically electives) during one or more summer semesters, and (2) beginning graduate coursework during the senior year. Details are available from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education.

Honors Program

The Computer Engineering Program offers Departmental Honors for outstanding students in the BS Computer Engineering degree program. Admission to the Honors programs requires that the student meet the following qualifications:

Has repeated no more than 3 courses at UT Dallas and has repeated no course more than once.

Graduation with Honors requires a 3.500 or better GPA and completion of either CE 4399 or CE 4V98. A Senior Honors Thesis must be completed within one of those two classes. (While the topics may be related, the Senior Thesis does not replace the need for the student to complete a regular Senior Design Project).

Departmental Honors with Distinction may be awarded to students whose Senior Honors Thesis is judged by a faculty committee to be of exemplary quality. Only students graduating with Departmental Honors are eligible. Thesis/projects must be submitted by the deadline that applies to MS Theses in the graduating semester to allow for proper evaluation. Students interested in Honors with Distinction are encouraged to start working on their thesis/project a year prior to graduation.

Minors

The School of Engineering and Computer Science does not offer a minor in Computer Engineering at this time.

1. Semester credit hours fulfill the communication component of the Core Curriculum.

2. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted under Mathematics Core, and five semester credit hours of Calculus are counted as Component Area Option Core.

3. Six semester credit hours of Physics are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics (PHYS 2125) is counted as Component Area Option Core.

4. Transfer students with sufficient background may petition to substitute upper-division semester credit hours in the major for this class.
