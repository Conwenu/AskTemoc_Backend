School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics

The Biology Program at UT Dallas emphasizes the unifying molecular and cellular nature of organisms. At the center of the Biology undergraduate curriculum are the biochemical, genetic, and cell biology concepts and tools used to study the genes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, to study the proteins and ribonucleic acids (RNA) encoded by these genes, and to study how the expression of these genes is regulated during the development and lifetimes of organisms. Molecular Biology represents a fusion of the four disciplines of biochemistry, biophysics, genetics, and cell biology. Modern biology requires a background in other disciplines such as chemistry, mathematics, physics, and computer sciences. Principles from these disciplines have to be merged to understand and apply new biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques. It is desirable for entering students to have a broad interest and background in the sciences.

Biology (BA, BS)

Both BS and BA degrees are offered in Biology at UT Dallas. The BS degrees are intended as preparation for scientific careers in biology or careers in the health professions. The BA degree is intended as a liberal arts biology major with less emphasis on calculus and more semester credit hours free for coursework in other disciplines. Biology offers a streamlined double major with Business Administration or Criminology. Accelerated BS/MS Fast Track programs are available that provide the opportunity to partially satisfy the requirements of a master's degree while completing the bachelor's degree in Biology.

UTeach Option

The UTeach option may be added to either the BA or BS degree. UTeach Dallas Option degree plans are streamlined to allow students to complete both a rigorous Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree and all coursework for middle or high school teacher certification in four years. Teaching Option degrees require deep content knowledge combined with courses grounded in the latest research on math and science education. While most graduates go on to classroom teaching, UTeach alums are also prepared to enter graduate school and to work in a discipline related industry.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees

For students with strong academic record who intend to pursue master's studies at UT Dallas, accelerated BS/MS Fast Tracks are available. After Fast Track admission to an MS program, students may take up to 15 semester credit hours of approved graduate courses in their senior year to use toward completion of both the BS and MS degrees. The available Fast Track options and their admission requirements, if any, in addition to having completed 90 or more semester credit hours (out of which 36 hours are from the core curriculum) with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00, are as follows:

MS in Molecular and Cell Biology: Students must have a GPA of at least 3.20 and have completed BIOL 2311, BIOL 2312, and BIOL 2281, or equivalent courses.
MS in Biotechnology: Students must have a GPA of at least 3.20 and have completed BIOL 2311, BIOL 2312, and BIOL 2281, or equivalent courses.
MS in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology: Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.
MS in Data Science and Statistics: (Only Data Science and Applied Statistics specializations) Students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.20 in all mathematics and statistics courses.

Interested students, after reviewing the UT Dallas Fast Track policy, should contact their undergraduate advisor and the graduate advisor of the intended MS program well in advance of their junior year to prepare a course sequence permitting maximal advantage and apply to the Fast Track program.

Degree Planning

Upper-division biology courses taken at other institutions may be included as part of the degree plan subject to the provisions of the section on Transfer Admissions.

Major-related courses may not include more than 9 semester credit hours (BS) or 6 semester credit hours (BA) of upper-division transfer credit and not more than 3 semester credit hours (Biology major) or 6 semester credit hours (Molecular Biology major) of individual instruction (e.g., BIOL 3V90, BIOL 3V91, BIOL 3V96, BIOL 4302, BIOL 4390, BIOL 4391, BIOL 4399, or BIOL 4V99).

Students planning a career in a particular allied health profession should consult the school they expect to attend to apprise themselves of the course requirements for admission.

Admission standards for medical and dental schools are set by the individual professional school, whose specific requirements should be reviewed with the help of the UT Dallas Health Professions Advising Center (HPAC). Most professional schools prefer that admission applications be channeled through the HPAC.

Minors

Students must take a minimum of 18 semester credit hours for the minor, 12 of which must be upper-division semester credit hours. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). Semester credit hours may not be used to satisfy both the major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor.

For all minors in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics students must complete all prerequisite sequences for required minor courses.
