Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Visual and Performing Arts (BA) with Art History Concentration

Students who complete the major in Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) pursue an interdisciplinary study of the arts by completing a major core that includes courses in writing, interdisciplinary studies, historical context, theory, and practice. The VPA major culminates in a Senior Capstone. Students who are majoring in VPA can focus their studies by choosing from nine possible concentrations.

The Art History concentration allows students to gain depth in the global arts, ranging across geography, chronology, and medium. Students in the concentration learn how to critically look and evaluate visual images and our built environment, assessing complex objects and their historical, social, and aesthetic meaning. Communications skills are developed through in-depth reading, writing, and presentation. The program makes use of the area's many terrific museums as well as the resources of UT-Dallas's Edith O'Donnell Institute for Art History. The degree allows for the study of complementary disciplines within the Visual and Performing Arts.

At least one-half of the total semester credit hours for major requirements must be taken at UT Dallas.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Visual and Performing Arts are open to all students in the University.
