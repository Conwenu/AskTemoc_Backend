NOTES:
1	Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2	Students completing the 020 requirement with a MATH course must complete ALEKS exam prior to enrollment. PHIL 2303 does not require the ALEKS exam.
3	Lower-division Preparatory - AHST 1303 and AHST 1304. NOTE: If the student took one of these courses as their core, then the student may choose any free elective in its place as a lower-level major requirement.
4	Major Core - VPAS 3340, VPAS 4389, Capstone/Honors (VPAS 4390 or VPAS 4V99), and 3 semester credit hours of upper-level Related Courses from AHTC (excluding the AHST prefix)
5	Concentration - 15 semester credit hours of upper-division Historical Context courses & 9 semester credit hours of upper-division Visual and Performing Arts electives
6	Free Elective - any lower or upper-level course. Students may need to take some as upper-level to meet the university requirement of earning a minimum of 45 semester credit hours of upper-level courses.
7	Major Core (Capstone/Honors) = VPAS 4390 or VPAS 4v99.

Be sure to check prerequisites of 2000-level or higher courses.
