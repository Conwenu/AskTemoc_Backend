School of Interdisciplinary Studies
Interdisciplinary Studies (BA, BS)

The Bachelor's degrees in Interdisciplinary Studies (BAIS) emphasize a broad learning experience and a wider perspective than that provided by traditional undergraduate majors. They are designed to offer the student the opportunity to participate in an interdisciplinary, coherent, academically sound, and goal-oriented education directly relevant to the student's intellectual development and career aspirations. They are appropriate for those students who seek a thorough grounding in the traditional arts and sciences from an interdisciplinary perspective. Each student in the Interdisciplinary Studies program becomes an active partner in the formulation of his or her program of study, working in consultation with an academic advisor to devise an appropriate individual degree plan. Within the framework of two foundation areas, a university-wide Interdisciplinary Studies sequence, and a multidisciplinary concentration, a student may draw upon the resources of all schools of the University to create a degree program.

Common areas of concentration for the BAIS are business issues, environmental studies, human resources, international relations, law, public relations, and urban studies. Graduates have been accepted into graduate programs in divinity, education, environmental studies, the health professions, humanities, interdisciplinary studies, law, management, and social sciences. The BS in Interdisciplinary Studies is selected by students interested in environmental studies, the health professions, and other science-related fields. Students interested in pre-health are advised to contact the Head of Healthcare Studies during their first semester.

Minors and Double Majors are not allowed in these two Interdisciplinary Studies degrees. In order to make the Interdisciplinary Studies degrees reflect their name, no more than 21 semester credit hours of courses with the same prefix are allowed in the combined major requirements and the 6 semester credit hours of electives. (All courses taught by the Naveen Jindal School of Management courses count as a single prefix.) In the major requirements and 6 semester credit hours of electives, the plan must include sufficient upper-division courses to total 45 upper-division semester credit hours. In the concentration, a minimum of three (3) prefixes must be represented. Please consult an academic advisor for further elaboration.

The BAIS and BSIS are geared toward non-Education majors. For those students who wish to pursue a future in the field of Education, UT Dallas offers both a Bachelor's of Arts in Education and a Bachelor's of Science in Education through the School of Interdisciplinary Studies.
