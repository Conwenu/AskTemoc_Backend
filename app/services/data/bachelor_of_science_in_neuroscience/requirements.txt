Neuroscience (BS)

Neuroscience is the multidisciplinary study of nervous system function that draws on recent advances in cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, computer, behavioral and cognitive sciences. It examines the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system's global and nanoscale biochemistry, its complex and extensively networked morphology, and its remarkably adaptive physiology. The field considers neuronal development from early embryology through advanced senescence. Further, neurobiologists examine neuronal plasticity from the level of single proteins, of individual neurons, up through the level of networks or systems of cells, and up to complete behaving organisms. Neuroscience studies the regulation and expression of behavior, the impact of that behavior on neurons, and the complex interactions of multiple neuronal systems that underlie the emergence of cognitive and sensory functions. The Neuroscience program at UT Dallas provides students with opportunities to focus on the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral neurons from a systems and cellular-level perspective, drawing on behavioral and cognitive expertise combined with smaller-scale neuronal and molecular analyses. It allows undergraduates extensive interactions with working neuroscientists who use the latest experimental techniques.

The Neuroscience program is designed to prepare students for admission to medical, dental or allied-health graduate schools (through the Medical Neuroscience track), for admission to research-based doctoral training programs (through the Research Neuroscience track), or for careers in biomedical science, industry, and allied health fields (through the Industrial Neuroscience track). Required courses within the Medical track include the approved pre-medical curriculum and offer a popular alternative to other pre-health majors. Students who wish to continue their education in the fields of medicine, dentistry or allied health professions should also register with the Health Professions Advising Center during their first semester.

Students can choose between three program tracks: Medical Neuroscience Track, Research Neuroscience Track, or Industrial Neuroscience Track to meet their career training needs. All tracks share a Core Curriculum and Neuroscience major requirements that can be completed in a minimum of 82 semester credit hours. Different coursework is required within the different tracks, with the total number of credit hours required for graduation the same for all three tracks.
