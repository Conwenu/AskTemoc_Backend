Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Literature (BA)

Students who complete the major in Literature receive a thorough grounding in literary ideas and methods, competence in particular national literatures, as well as the ability to work across literatures and languages. By engaging literary works appropriate to one of the country's most diverse campuses, this major teaches both specialized knowledge and the skills to deepen and broaden knowledge of literature that is new or unfamiliar. The ideal graduate would be able to approach English-language literary works from anywhere in the world with a set of intelligent questions and the capacity to produce equally intelligent solutions to interpretative problems. By selecting a variety of courses from a variety of headings, students are able to combine courses in criticism and interpretation, in writing and translation, and in English and foreign languages. Students may also pursue teaching certification.

At least one-half of the semester credit hours for the major must be taken at UT Dallas.
