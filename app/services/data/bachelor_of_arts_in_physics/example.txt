NOTES:
1	Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2	One semester credit hour of Calculus is counted as Major Preparatory credit; three semester credit hours are counted in Core Curriculum. Students may choose either calculus sequence (MATH 2413 and MATH 2414 and MATH 2415) or (MATH 2417 and MATH 2419 and MATH 2451).
3	Counted in Core Curriculum Science.
4	Counted in Core Curriculum in Component Area Option.
5	Indicates a prerequisite class to be completed before enrolling in upper-division classes.
6	MATH 2413 or MATH 2417 is a prerequisite for PHYS 2325 and MATH 2414 or MATH 2419 is a corequisite for PHYS 2325
7	MATH 2414 or MATH 2419 is a prerequisite for PHYS 2326.
8	PHYS 2421 may be electively substituted for PHYS 2325. (Requires a minimum grade of B+ in either MATH 2413 or MATH 2417)
9	Students who complete PHYS 2421 do not need to complete PHYS 2125.
10	PHYS 2422 may be electively substituted for PHYS 2326.

45 Hours of upper division courses (course numbers beginning with 3 or greater) are required for all degrees.
Be sure to check prerequisites of 2000-level or higher courses.
120 semester credit hours required for graduation

Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) during the summer are highly recommended for Physics majors planning to continue their education in graduate school, whether in physics or another discipline. Formal REU programs exist at many universities, national laboratories, and even overseas, and usually offer a stipend typical of a graduate teaching assistantship. Announcements for REU programs usually appear online in December and application deadlines usually range from late January to early March. Requirements vary, but students are often eligible if they have completed their freshman year.

This plan is a resource tool only; it does not replace your degree plan or academic advising.
