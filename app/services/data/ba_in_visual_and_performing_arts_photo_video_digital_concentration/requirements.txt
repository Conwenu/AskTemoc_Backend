Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Visual and Performing Arts (BA) with Photo-Video-Digital Concentration

Students who complete the major in Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) pursue an interdisciplinary study of the arts by completing a major core that includes courses in writing, interdisciplinary studies, historical context, theory and practice. The VPA major culminates in a Senior Capstone. Students who are majoring in VPA can focus their studies by choosing from nine possible concentrations.

The Photo-Video-Digital Concentration focuses on the theories, concepts and skills of creative work generated using digital and lens-based technologies, specifically photography, video, and digital art. Students will learn traditional and innovative techniques as well as acquire a broad base of knowledge in art practice and history.

At least one-half of the total semester credit hours for major requirements must be taken at UT Dallas.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Visual and Performing Arts are open to all students in the University.
