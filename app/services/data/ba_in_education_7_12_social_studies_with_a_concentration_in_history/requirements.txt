UT Dallas offers rigorous university-based teacher certification curricula and enjoys an outstanding reputation for producing excellent teachers.

At UT Dallas, coursework and field experiences leading to teacher certification may be accomplished through either the Teacher Development Center (TDC) program in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies (972-883-2730) or through UTeach Dallas program in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (NS&M) (972-883-2496).

UT Dallas School of Interdisciplinary Studies offers both a Bachelor of Arts in Education degree (BAED) and a Bachelor of Science in Education degree (BSED). Each degree emphasizes a broad understanding and wide perspective of the field of education. Becoming a teacher takes preparation and planning. To ensure the highest professional standards, the state of Texas and UT Dallas require students to pass a series of rigorous courses, complete extensive fieldwork and demonstrate their knowledge of content and educational expertise on state licensure exams to become fully certified as a highly qualified teacher in Texas. The TDC at UT Dallas offers all the preparation courses required for teacher certification, including practical classes in curriculum and instruction, educational technology, and classroom management. The TDC interfaces and engages with all academic schools at UT Dallas, as well as many area school districts, to assist students as they progress through the teacher certification program. The Teacher Development Center at UT Dallas is fully accredited by the Texas Education Agency.

All BAED and BSED students are required to select a certification focus before their junior year.
