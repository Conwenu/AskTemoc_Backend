NOTES:
1	Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2	A Major requirement that also fulfills a Core Curriculum requirement.
3	Three semester credit hours are counted to fulfill the Mathematics Core Requirement with the remaining semester credit hour to be counted under the major requirements.
4	MATH 2417 and MATH 2419 requirements can be fulfilled by completing MATH 2413, MATH 2414, and MATH 2415. May affect other prerequisites.
5	Students will take one of the Physics sequences: (PHYS 2325 and PHYS 2326) or (PHYS 2421 and PHYS 2422) with accompanying labs.
6	45 semester credit hours of upper division courses are required for all degrees.
7	Geosciences has two required summer field trips
8	Class has an associated problem section (LBR) which also must be registered
9	Major Core Option - Select one from the following: GEOS 3310 or GEOS 4395

Be sure to check prerequisites of 2000-level or higher courses.
120 semester credit hours required for graduation

Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) during the summer are highly recommended for Physics majors planning to continue their education in graduate school, whether in physics or another discipline. Formal REU programs exist at many universities, national laboratories, and even overseas, and usually offer a stipend typical of a graduate teaching assistantship. Announcements for REU programs usually appear online in December and application deadlines usually range from late January to early March. Requirements vary, but students are often eligible if they have completed their freshman year.
