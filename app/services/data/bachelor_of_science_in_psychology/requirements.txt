Psychology (BS)

Psychology is the study of thinking and behavior. It is both an area of scientific inquiry and a field of applied practice. The science of psychology is concerned with understanding how people perceive, learn, feel, think, develop, and interact with others. The practice of psychology applies this knowledge to help people improve their mental health, learning, relationships, and more.

An undergraduate degree in psychology can support many career options. Because a psychology major provides students with knowledge about human behavior and trains them in research methods and data analysis, it is useful for students planning careers in social work, law, management, business, or medicine. Some students may choose to continue their study of psychology in graduate school, a path that can enable professional careers as a clinical, counseling, industrial, or academic (e.g., professors) psychologists.

The Psychology program at UT Dallas approaches psychology from a scientific perspective, training students to apply empirical methods to study the human mind and behavior. Psychology students learn to evaluate and generate evidence relating to theories of social behavior, personality development, perception, memory, brain processes, and other facets of the human experience. Students also gain hands-on experience through laboratory participation, internship placements, directed research experiences in professors' labs, and individualized study with faculty in specialized topics.

The undergraduate degree awarded through the Psychology program is a Bachelor of science. Students can choose electives to obtain a broader grounding in psychology or a general education in the liberal arts. It is also possible to select clusters of electives to support concentrations tailored for specific career paths and graduate study (see below). Students can complete the Core Curriculum and Psychology major requirements in a minimum of 78 semester credit hours, leaving 42 elective semester credit hours.
