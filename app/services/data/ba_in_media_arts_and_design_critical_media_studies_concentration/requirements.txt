Harry W. Bass Jr. School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology
Media Arts and Design (BA) with Critical Media Studies Concentration

This Concentration provides a thorough grounding in thinking critically, analytically, and creatively about media, their use, and their historical development. CMS Concentration students have the opportunity to perform critical media research and engage in the critical creative production of media. The CMS Concentration examines the ethical and social dimensions of media and applies that knowledge in the creation and analysis of digital media texts. By selecting courses from a variety of School elective headings, students are able to infuse other areas of interest into their focus on Critical Media Studies.

Unless otherwise noted, courses in Media Arts and Design are open to all students in the University. However, students majoring in Media Arts and Design may be given preference in certain course enrollments.

Major Honors

MAD seniors in the CMS concentration who have completed at least 30 graded upper-division semester credit hours and have a major GPA of 3.67 may elect to participate in Major Honors. These students can either complete a thesis or project under the supervision of an AHT faculty member and a second reader, or enroll in an advanced lab or topics course and complete a thesis related to the course content under the supervision of an AHT faculty member.

Students should consult their AHT academic advisor for further details.
